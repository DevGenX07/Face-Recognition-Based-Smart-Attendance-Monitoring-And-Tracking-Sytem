# ABSTRACT: 
The automatic Face recognition system has become one of the most popular technologies in the past few years for its applications in various fields such as security, surveillance, and identity verification. The main intention of this system is to perform an automatic system for human face recognition for an institution or organization to have the attendance of their students or employees. This paper aims to provide an extensive overview of face recognition systems including its history, methodology, working principle, and applications. 

# INTRODUCTION:
The automatic face recognition system is one of the most significant research attentions in recent years. Face recognition technology has become an important tool in different applications such as access control, forensic analysis, and identity verification. It can match a human face from a digital image against a database of faces. This system is employed to certify users through ID verification services. This system was started developing in the 1960s, started as a form of Computer application. Since their beginning, facial recognition has become one of the most used technologies [14]. These days, face recognition is used on smartphones, also used in industries to confirm the identity. In biometric face recognition technology uses computer algorithms to analyze and identify one's unique facial features [8]. The process of face recognition basically goes through capturing an image of a person's face, extracting unique features from the image, and comparing those features with a database of shape of the jawline, the size of nose, the contours of face etc. As technology grows, attendances are stored in a database with security. All the information concerning the students is kept within the database. So that Manual attending can be replaced bythe RFID [1]. In order to beat the drawbacks of the RFID, the biometric authentication was introduced. Biometric authentication includes thumb impression, iris pattern and face detection [1]. In a classroom with a high teacher-to-student ratio, it turns into an extremely dreary and tedious process to mark the attendance physically and cumulative attendance of each student. Consequently, we can execute a viable framework which will mark the attendance of students automatically via face recognition.

The histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) algorithm is additionally one of the significant calculations that has been broadly utilized under the territory of Machine learning. This strategy can be to a great extent sent for different article identification just as countenances of the subject [4]. All pictures utilized are changed over to grayscale and each pixel in this picture is allocated a number. Every single pixel includes itself in a correlation method where it looks at its incentive to its neighboring pixels [8]. The inspiration is to locate the included dull district will have a white bolt pointing towards it. Every pixel is made to experience through a similar procedure. The biometric system is efficient, reliable and provides a high level of security when compared to the traditional authentication methods. However, these systems offer some disadvantages as well. Most of the devices are unable to enroll some small percentage of users, and the performance of the system can deteriorate over time [9]. To overcome these disadvantages face recognition-based authentication techniques are developed. Face recognition technology involves scanning the distinctive features of the human face to authorize the student [5]. The face recognition system works based on the values of the nodal points on the person’s face. The values measured with each nodal points helps in identifying and verifying the person ‘s face. These values captured from 
the face’s nodal point are given to other applications or software to identify the person easily and accurately [3].We have divided the whole work into five different sections. Section I contains the Introduction of the work, Section II contains Literature Survey, section III contains which Methodology has been used, section IV contains the Working Principle of the whole work, section V contains the Output of the Project and section VI contains Conclusion.

# METHODOLOGY:
A face recognition attendance system is a system which uses facial recognition technology to identify individuals and record their attendance. The following are the steps involved in the methodology of a typical face recognition attendance system. The very first step in the face recognition attendance system is to capture the images of the individuals. This can be done using a camera or a webcam. The captured images are then pre-processed to remove distortions. This step helps to improve the accuracy of the face recognition system. The next step is to extract the features of the face. The system uses different algorithms (here we are going to use HOG) to identify the critical features of the face, such as the eyes, nose, mouth, etc. After all the features are extracted, the system compares them with the stored database of faces to identify the individual. If the system recognizes the person, the attendance is recorded in excel sheet automatically. The system updates the database when individual’s face is recognized successfully. The system generates attendance reports for everyone, including the time and date of the attendance, and other relevant information.

The HOG stands for Histogram of Oriented Gradients. This algorithm is a popular approach which is used for object detection and recognition. In case of HOG algorithm, firstly the image is divided into some small square regions which are called cells. For every cell, the gradient of the image is computed by a series of filters. Those filters can detect the direction and magnitude of edges in that image. The gradient values are then accumulated into histograms based on their orientation; it results a set of histograms that capture the dominant edge orientations within every cell. Then the histograms are combined across adjacent cells to form larger blocks. Every block some cells and each histogram in the block is normalized by the total energy of the block. This normalization helps to make the algorithm more powerful. Finally, the normalized blocks are integrated to form a feature vector that represents the image. This feature vector can then be used in a machine learning algorithm, such as a support vector machine (SVM), to classify objects within the image.The HOG algorithm has been used in a different application, including pedestrian detection, face detection, and object recognition.

Overall, a face recognition attendance system uses facial recognition technology to identify individuals and record their attendance automatically. The system involves capturing images, pre-processing, feature extraction, face recognition, updating the database, and generating attendance reports.

# WORKING PRINCIPLE:
This project, Face recognition and attendance monitoring system has gone through several working processes like Face Detection, Face Alignment, Feature Extraction and comparison, Identification and Identification and authentication. Those are explained below:

FACE DETECTION: At first view the given photo and identify how many faces are present in the photo. The given photo is encoded to a simplified version of image using Histogram of Oriented Gradients Algorithm. That simplified image is used to find that image part the mostly looks like generic Histogram of Oriented Gradients encoding of a face.

FACE ALIGNMENT: As soon as the face has been detected, system will align that face to a standard size and position. This is done to ensure that the face can be compared accurately to other faces. Figure out the pose of the face by finding the main landmarks in the face. Once we find those landmarks, use them to wrap the image so that the eyes and the mouth are centered. 

FEATURE EXTRACTION AND COMPARISON: The system then extract features from the face such as the position and the shape of the eyes, nose, and mouth. The features are unique to each individual and can be used to identify a person. The features extracted from the face are then compared to a database of known faces. The database contains a collection of features from known individuals along with their names and other identifying information and pass the centered face image through a neutral network that knows how to measure features of the face. Save those 128 measurements.

IDENTIFICATION and AUTHENTICATION: If the features extracted from the face match those in the database, the system identifies the person. If there is no match, the system concludes that the person is not in the database. Once the person is identified, the system can then authenticate the person's identity by comparing the features extracted from the face to a stored template of the person's face. Looking at all the faces we have measured in the past, see which person has the closest measurements to our face’s measurements. That is our match!.

Overall, the working principle of a face recognition system involves detecting and aligning a face, extracting unique features, comparing them to a database, identifying the person, and authenticating their identity. Now that you know how this all works, here’s instructions from start-to-finish of how run this entire face recognition pipeline on your own computer.

# FUTURE SCOPE and CONCLUSION:
The future scope of automatic face recognition systems is huge and holds significant potential in different domains. Here are some potential areas where face recognition systems may find applications:

1. SECURITY AND LAW ENFORCEMENT: Automatic face recognition can increase security measures by identifying individuals in real-time, aiding in surveillance, and improving access control systems. It can be used in airports, public places, and government facilities to identify potential threats or suspects.

2. CUSTOMER SERVICE AND PERSONALIZATION: Businesses can take advantage of face recognition systems to enhance customer experiences. By recognizing customers' faces, companies can provide personalized services, targeted marketing, and customized recommendations based on individual preferences.

4. HUMAN-COMPUTER INTERACTION: Face recognition can restructure the way humans interact with computers and devices. It can enable natural user interfaces, such as facial gestures and expressions, for controlling devices, playing games, or browsing interfaces without physical contact.

6. HEALTHCARE MONITORING AND AGE ESTIMATION: Face recognition algorithms can be used for monitoring patients' 
health conditions by analyzing facial expressions, detecting signs of pain or distress, and providing personalized care accordingly. On 
top of that, face recognition can estimate a person's age, aiding in age-restricted services or personalized marketing campaigns.

8. EDUCATION AND ATTENDANCE MANAGEMENT: Face recognition systems can simplify attendance tracking in schools, universities reducing administrative burden and ensuring exact records. They can also be used for monitoring students' engagement during virtual classes.

10. SMART CITIES AND PUBLIC SERVICES: Face recognition can come up with smart city initiatives by optimizing traffic management, public safety, and crowd control. It can also aid in identifying wanted individuals, reducing crime rates, and enhancing overall city management.

11. SOCIAL MEDIA AND ENTERTAINMENT: Face recognition applications has already found in social media platforms for automatically tagging individuals in photos. In the future, it could be used for more advanced features like generating personalized content, analyzing emotions, and enhancing virtual reality experiences.

It's important to bear in mind that the future of face recognition technology also raises ethical and privacy concerns, which need to be addressed to guarantee responsible use and protect individual rights.
In order to obtain the attendance of individual and to record their time of entry and exit, the authors proposed the attendance management system based on face recognition technology in the institutions/organizations. The face recognition attendance system can be fused with other systems such as HR management, access control systems etc. This will provide a comprehensive solution for organizations to manage their employees' attendance and related activities. The face recognition attendance system can be customized to suit the needs of different organizations. For example, the system can be customized to record attendance for specific departments or by adding some more feature it can record the exact time and some details of that employee. The system takes attendance of each student by continuous observation at the entry and exit points. The result of our preliminary experiment shows improved performance in the estimation of the attendance compared to the traditional black and white attendance systems. Current work is focused on the face detection algorithms from images or video frames.
